# React Materialize Playground
A demo to test the React Materialize sandbox. (This repository is in development)

## Purpose
A sandbox site for me to play around with making a React site using the Materialize theme.

##Instructions
If you want to try it out, please do the following:
1. Git clone both this repository and my koa-rest-server project.
2. Start the koa-rest-server project first and then this one by typing ```gulp``` in the terminal window.
3. TODO: Mocha tests using Enzyme need to be added.
